# CUSTOMER ORDER CHALLENGE

## Overview 
This project is fully contained in "menu.py", which is a simple script used to mimic a customer interaction with an employee at a cash register. A general menu is defined, from which a customer will then select sub-menus (snacks, meals, etc.), each of which contain dictionaries of their own specific food items. For example, snacks would contain key-value pairs for things like the sub-menu number/selection, food name, and price. Once an item is selected, the user chooses the quantity of the item to order. This is added to a list associated with the user's order which is then printed out once the user is finished ordering. Additionally, the prices of each item are summed, and the total cost is displayed to the user at the end of the program.
